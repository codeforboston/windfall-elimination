                    The amount your benefit is reduced in the Windfall Elimination Provision formula depends on how many years you worked in “covered employment,” or how many years you paid into Social Security. Social Security only counts years where you earned a “substantial amount” in covered wages. The amount for “substantial” is set by the Social Security Administration every year.
