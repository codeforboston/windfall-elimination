## Windfall Elimination Provision, American Social Security

We are building a tool to help retirees affected by the Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP). WEP mostly affects public servants like teachers and firefighters, and can mean a reduction in SSA benefits of up to 50%. This tool will help affected workers better plan retirement and self-advocate with the Social Security administration
